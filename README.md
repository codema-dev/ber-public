This `Python` toolkit simplifies use of the SEAI's BER Public search dataset with the help of:
- [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests) - to download the latest version from SEAI
- [`dask`](https://github.com/dask/dask) - to manipulate big, tabular data (~1GB raw)
- [`Google Colaboratory`](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) or [`mybinder Notebook`](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) sandboxes - to use this toolkit for free in your browser using cloud infrastructure
